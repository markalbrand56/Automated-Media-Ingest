# Automated Media Ingest
This is a simple project to practice Go. My goal is to be able to automatically ingest footage from my camera's SD card to my dedicated directory with a custom folder structure, because Sony's own folder structure has given me some minor issues.

## Directory structure
This program generates a structure based of folders named after their files' modification dates. The format for their names is `yyyy-mm-dd` for better organization.
